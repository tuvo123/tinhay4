										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An old man turned to me and asked: &#8220;How many friends do you have?&#8221;. &#8220;Why do you ask that? I have 10 or 20 friends, but I can only remember a few of their names.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled as if he understood and then sadly nodded:</p>
<p>&#8211; You must be very lucky to have so many friends. But think about what she was saying. There are too many people she did not know the name of it! You are not just someone for her to say: hello!</p>
<p>You are the person who has a soft shoulder for her to cry on.</p>
<p>A well into which to pour all your risks and increase your value.</p>
<p>You were a hand to pull her up from the darkness and despair when everyone she called “friends” had pushed her into.</p>
<p>A true friend is an ally who cannot be swayed or bribed. Be a voice to keep her name alive when others have forgotten.</p>
<p>But the most necessary thing in a friend is a heart, a strong and towering wall. From the hearts of those friends we will have the most wonderful love.</p>
<p>So think about what I say, every word is sincere.</p>
<p>And answer me again, girl, how many friends do you have?</p>
<p>I smiled at him and replied: &#8220;At least I have a friend, old man!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for being my friend!<a href="https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/">https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terror filled the heart of a World War I soldier when he saw his lifelong friend fall in battle.<br />
Trapped in a trench and artillery shells flying continuously overhead, the soldier asked his commander to allow him to go out into the &#8220;plain area&#8221; between the trenches to bring back his wounded comrade.</p>
<p>The commander said:</p>
<p>&#8211; You can go but I think the job won&#8217;t be worth it. Perhaps his friend was dead and he could lose his own life.</p>
<p>Regardless of the commander&#8217;s words, the soldier still left. Miraculously, he managed to reach his friend, lifted him onto his shoulders, and carried him back to their trench. As they both tumbled into the trench, the commander checked on the hit soldier and then looked sympathetically at his friend.</p>
<p>-I told you, that job is not worth it. &#8211; The commander said &#8211; Your friend is dead, and you are seriously injured.</p>
<p>The soldier replied:</p>
<p>&#8211; Even so, the job is still worth doing, boss.</p>
<p>&#8211; What do you mean by worth doing? Your friend is dead, right?</p>
<p>-Boss, it was worth doing because when I got to him, he was still alive and I was very satisfied when he told me &#8220;Jim, I knew that you would definitely come to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>In life, whether something is worth doing or not depends entirely on how we look at it. Be courageous and do what your heart tells you so that later in life you won&#8217;t have to regret not doing it. Hopefully each and every one of us will be in the true arms of such friends.<a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language">Vietnamese</a><a href="https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/">https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There were quite a few people attending the wedding. The neighbor called his worker over and said: &#8211; Hey, let&#8217;s go see how many people are attending the wedding over there.<br />
Physicians do leave. He placed a piece of wood on the threshold and sat on the wall waiting for guests to leave the house. They start to leave. Everyone who went out tripped over a log, cursed and continued walking. Only an old woman tripped over a log and immediately turned around and pushed the log aside.</p>
<p>Uncle workers returned to the owner.</p>
<p>The owner asked:</p>
<p>&#8211; Are there many people there?</p>
<p>The worker replied:</p>
<p>&#8211; There&#8217;s only one person and it&#8217;s an old woman.</p>
<p>&#8211; Why so?</p>
<p>&#8211; Because I left a log on the doorstep, everyone tripped over it, but no one bothered to remove it. Then do the same sheep. But an old woman pushed the log aside so that others wouldn&#8217;t trip and fall. The only man to do so. The old woman was alone.<a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language">Vietnamese</a><a href="https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/">https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/</a></p>
