										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An old man turned to me and asked: &#8220;How many friends do you have?&#8221;. &#8220;Why do you ask that? I have 10 or 20 friends, but I can only remember a few of their names.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled as if he understood and then sadly nodded:</p>
<p>&#8211; You must be very lucky to have so many friends. But think about what she was saying. There are too many people she did not know the name of it! You are not just someone for her to say: hello!</p>
<p>You are the person who has a soft shoulder for her to cry on.</p>
<p>A well into which to pour all your risks and increase your value.</p>
<p>You were a hand to pull her up from the darkness and despair when everyone she called “friends” had pushed her into.</p>
<p>A true friend is an ally who cannot be swayed or bribed. Be a voice to keep her name alive when others have forgotten.</p>
<p>But the most necessary thing in a friend is a heart, a strong and towering wall. From the hearts of those friends we will have the most wonderful love.</p>
<p>So think about what I say, every word is sincere.</p>
<p>And answer me again, girl, how many friends do you have?</p>
<p>I smiled at him and replied: &#8220;At least I have a friend, old man!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for being my friend!<a href="https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/">https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/</a></p>
