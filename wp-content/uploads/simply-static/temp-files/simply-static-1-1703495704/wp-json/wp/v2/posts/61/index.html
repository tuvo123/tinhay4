But the author still cannot hide his aesthetic emotions at what he sees every year. Regarding the coming of Tet, people have many ways to say: either directly, concisely like &#8220;Tet is coming&#8221; or &#8220;spring is coming&#8221;; Or choose a typical image of Tet, of spring like a swallow, like new sunshine, like blooming peach blossoms. Vu Dinh Lien chose the last option. It&#8217;s also nothing new. The flute is different. There have been countless people who have written like that: peach blossoms and winter and spring winds. Anyway, Vu Dinh Lien&#8217;s choice is also very meaningful: &#8220;Every year peach blossoms bloom&#8221; is chosen to introduce spring in its most beautiful corner. In that corner, next to the peach blossoms, seemingly blooming with the peach blossoms, is an old man with black ink and red paper and perhaps, a head of white hair.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Tu &#8220;blooms&#8221; with peach blossoms, and with peach blossoms, Mr. Tu becomes a symbol of spring: in the bustling crowd of people walking on the street enjoying spring, there was a large number of people stopping next to him. him, contemplating his hand moving the pen nimbly &#8220;like a phoenix dancing with a dragon&#8221; on cashew paper. Admiring that hand, they used the word: &#8220;flower hand.&#8221; With that word &#8220;flower hand&#8221;, people no longer consider him as a disciple, a teacher, or a person who spreads the words of saints and sages, but consider him as an artist. The aesthetic aspect of him stands out, overwhelming the educational aspect.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the word &#8220;flower&#8221; in &#8220;hand flower&#8221; cannot help but evoke the word &#8220;peach blossom&#8221; in the first sentence: it seems that, when spring comes, there are two types of flowers blooming at the same time, one in the garden and one in the garden. the master&#8217;s hand.<\/p>\n<p>In the resonance between the peach blossom and the grandfather, there is something a bit paradoxical and ironic: the peach blossom is a new flower and the person is an old person, &#8220;the old monk.&#8221; Behind him, therefore, is a whole past, a whole tradition. \u201cEvery year&#8230; see\u2026\u201d When does \u201cevery year\u201d mean? Maybe not very long. In the past, when asking for parallel sentences, including Tet couplets, people probably went to the homes of monks or retired academicians &#8211; as in the case of Nguyen Khuyen, who made countless parallel sentences that are still available today. be reminded. The phenomenon of &#8220;displaying Chinese ink on red paper \/ on a crowded street,&#8221; if I guess correctly, is just one of the manifestations of the trend of commercialization and urbanization that has occurred in Vietnam since the late 19th century. when Vietnam was invaded by France. It is a new profession for old people. This irony contains a historical tragedy. It reminds us of the fact that, along with foreign invasion, Vietnamese society was completely turned upside down, which, directly related to the fate of our grandfather, was the decline of Confucianism. That decline leads to the loss of a whole class of people who, at one time, we still considered symbols of traditional Vietnamese culture. \u201cThere&#8217;s nothing wrong with the word grapes. &#8220;I&#8217;m tired, even I&#8217;m lying down,&#8221; Tu Xuong once cried out, aching and heartbroken. In that chaotic situation, students flocked to learn Western language. He had to say goodbye to the school, the holy words, the literary reviews and reading sessions to accept the sad way of making a living by writing couplets for Tet every spring.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily for him, the change in cultural traditions is often slower than the change in history, politics, society, and the educational and examination systems. The masses still have the habit of respecting Chinese characters, at least during Tet days. That gave him, on the one hand, a way to make a living, and on the other hand, he still had friends who knew how to appreciate his talent, even if they were friends passing by. That enthusiastic enjoyment made his ironic seat on the sidewalk feel warm.<\/p>\n<p>The first two stanzas, therefore, not only speak of the resonance and harmony between humans and nature but also of the interconnection between humans. The monk did not sit alone with the peach blossoms. Besides him, there are also loyal customers. Around them, spring is fragrant and colorful. Pretty. And fun. Joy overflows into the storyteller&#8217;s words: his voice is loud and strong with words starting with the crisp consonant &#8220;d&#8221; (peach, do, red, east&#8230;); He spoke quickly, told in one go, without stopping, very enthusiastic, full of passion, very excited: in two verses, each of four lines, in terms of grammar, in fact, it was just one sentence, one just sentence:<\/p>\n<p>Every year peach blossoms bloom again<\/p>\n<p>I saw an old man displaying red ink and paper on a crowded street.<\/p>\n<p>Many people wrote notes praising his talent: &#8220;The palm flowers have features like a phoenix dancing and a dragon flying.&#8221;<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/tinhay4\/en\/how-many-friends-do-you-have\/\">http:\/\/localhost\/tinhay4\/en\/how-many-friends-do-you-have\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>A\u00a0<a title=\"Developing country\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Developing_country\">developing country<\/a>\u00a0with a lower-middle-income economy, Vietnam is one of the\u00a0<a title=\"List of countries by real GDP growth rate\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_countries_by_real_GDP_growth_rate\">fastest-growing economies<\/a>\u00a0of the 21st century.
