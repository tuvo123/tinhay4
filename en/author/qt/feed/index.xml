										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An old man turned to me and asked: &#8220;How many friends do you have?&#8221;. &#8220;Why do you ask that? I have 10 or 20 friends, but I can only remember a few of their names.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled as if he understood and then sadly nodded:</p>
<p>&#8211; You must be very lucky to have so many friends. But think about what she was saying. There are too many people she did not know the name of it! You are not just someone for her to say: hello!</p>
<p>You are the person who has a soft shoulder for her to cry on.</p>
<p>A well into which to pour all your risks and increase your value.</p>
<p>You were a hand to pull her up from the darkness and despair when everyone she called “friends” had pushed her into.</p>
<p>A true friend is an ally who cannot be swayed or bribed. Be a voice to keep her name alive when others have forgotten.</p>
<p>But the most necessary thing in a friend is a heart, a strong and towering wall. From the hearts of those friends we will have the most wonderful love.</p>
<p>So think about what I say, every word is sincere.</p>
<p>And answer me again, girl, how many friends do you have?</p>
<p>I smiled at him and replied: &#8220;At least I have a friend, old man!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for being my friend!<a href="https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/">https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Every year the peach blossoms bloom, I see the old man&#8230;&#8221; In Vietnam, related to the theme of Tet, perhaps there is no poem as widely popular as the poem &#8220;Mr. Do&#8221; by Vu Dinh Lien. (1913-96)<br />
Each year the flowers peach blossom<br />
That his old toys<br />
Paper presented red ink<br />
Inside a crowded street over<br />
How many tenants wrote<br />
User praise switch plates<br />
“Hypal flowers have strokes<br />
As phoenix dragon dance&#8221;.<br />
But every year it&#8217;s absent<br />
Where the tenant write this?<br />
Red paper petal sad;<br />
Research toner left in grief&#8230;<br />
He sat there map,<br />
Passers nobody or.<br />
Leaves fall on the paper;<br />
In addition to rain giời dust.<br />
Peach bloom again this year,<br />
Not seeing his old toys.<br />
Those who live forever<br />
Where soul now ?<br />
In the first two stanzas of the poem, the author uses purely narrative style, just telling the story, which is quite a normal story, like a habit, a familiar rhythm: &#8220;Every year&#8230; see&#8230;&#8221; It&#8217;s not surprising at all. But the author still cannot hide his aesthetic emotions at what he sees every year. Regarding the coming of Tet, people have many ways to say: either directly, concisely like &#8220;Tet is coming&#8221; or &#8220;spring is coming&#8221;; Or choose a typical image of Tet, of spring like a swallow, like new sunshine, like blooming peach blossoms. Vu Dinh Lien chose the last option. It&#8217;s also nothing new. The flute is different. There have been countless people who have written like that: peach blossoms and winter and spring winds. Anyway, Vu Dinh Lien&#8217;s choice is also very meaningful: &#8220;Every year peach blossoms bloom&#8221; is chosen to introduce spring in its most beautiful corner. In that corner, next to the peach blossoms, seemingly blooming with the peach blossoms, is an old man with black ink and red paper and perhaps, a head of white hair.</p>
<p>Mr. Tu &#8220;blooms&#8221; with peach blossoms, and with peach blossoms, Mr. Tu becomes a symbol of spring: in the bustling crowd of people walking on the street enjoying spring, there was a large number of people stopping next to him. him, contemplating his hand moving the pen nimbly &#8220;like a phoenix dancing with a dragon&#8221; on cashew paper. Admiring that hand, they used the word: &#8220;flower hand.&#8221; With that word &#8220;flower hand&#8221;, people no longer consider him as a disciple, a teacher, or a person who spreads the words of saints and sages, but consider him as an artist. The aesthetic aspect of him stands out, overwhelming the educational aspect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the word &#8220;flower&#8221; in &#8220;hand flower&#8221; cannot help but evoke the word &#8220;peach blossom&#8221; in the first sentence: it seems that, when spring comes, there are two types of flowers blooming at the same time, one in the garden and one in the garden. the master&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>In the resonance between the peach blossom and the grandfather, there is something a bit paradoxical and ironic: the peach blossom is a new flower and the person is an old person, &#8220;the old monk.&#8221; Behind him, therefore, is a whole past, a whole tradition. “Every year&#8230; see…” When does “every year” mean? Maybe not very long. In the past, when asking for parallel sentences, including Tet couplets, people probably went to the homes of monks or retired academicians &#8211; as in the case of Nguyen Khuyen, who made countless parallel sentences that are still available today. be reminded. The phenomenon of &#8220;displaying Chinese ink on red paper / on a crowded street,&#8221; if I guess correctly, is just one of the manifestations of the trend of commercialization and urbanization that has occurred in Vietnam since the late 19th century. when Vietnam was invaded by France. It is a new profession for old people. This irony contains a historical tragedy. It reminds us of the fact that, along with foreign invasion, Vietnamese society was completely turned upside down, which, directly related to the fate of our grandfather, was the decline of Confucianism. That decline leads to the loss of a whole class of people who, at one time, we still considered symbols of traditional Vietnamese culture. “There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the word grapes. &#8220;I&#8217;m tired, even I&#8217;m lying down,&#8221; Tu Xuong once cried out, aching and heartbroken. In that chaotic situation, students flocked to learn Western language. He had to say goodbye to the school, the holy words, the literary reviews and reading sessions to accept the sad way of making a living by writing couplets for Tet every spring.</p>
<p>Luckily for him, the change in cultural traditions is often slower than the change in history, politics, society, and the educational and examination systems. The masses still have the habit of respecting Chinese characters, at least during Tet days. That gave him, on the one hand, a way to make a living, and on the other hand, he still had friends who knew how to appreciate his talent, even if they were friends passing by. That enthusiastic enjoyment made his ironic seat on the sidewalk feel warm.</p>
<p>The first two stanzas, therefore, not only speak of the resonance and harmony between humans and nature but also of the interconnection between humans. The monk did not sit alone with the peach blossoms. Besides him, there are also loyal customers. Around them, spring is fragrant and colorful. Pretty. And fun. Joy overflows into the storyteller&#8217;s words: his voice is loud and strong with words starting with the crisp consonant &#8220;d&#8221; (peach, do, red, east&#8230;); He spoke quickly, told in one go, without stopping, very enthusiastic, full of passion, very excited: in two verses, each of four lines, in terms of grammar, in fact, it was just one sentence, one just sentence:</p>
<p>Every year peach blossoms bloom again</p>
<p>I saw an old man displaying red ink and paper on a crowded street.</p>
<p>Many people wrote notes praising his talent: &#8220;The palm flowers have features like a phoenix dancing and a dragon flying.&#8221;<a href="https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/how-many-friends-do-you-have/">https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/how-many-friends-do-you-have/</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a really strange poem. There are up to 8 different readings<br />
I love the bright spring scene<br />
The pleasures of poetry are filled with wine and cups<br />
Flowers placed on bamboo hedges with blue branches<br />
The leaves are fragrant with fresh spring fragrance<br />
Passengers go back and forth waiting for the river to calm down<br />
Back and forth the boat waits for a crowded dock<br />
The distant sound of singing and singing is deep<br />
A gentle silhouette with smiling eyes. 2. Read the original lesson backwards from the bottom up (we get lesson 2)<br />
Smiling and smiling with graceful eyes<br />
The bass and bass guitar sing in the distance<br />
People crowded the docks waiting for the boat to go back and forth<br />
The river&#8217;s waves are calm, waiting for guests to pass by<br />
Fresh spring color and scent mixed with leaves<br />
Green bamboo branches hung with flowers on the hedge<br />
Filled with a cup of poetic wine and joy<br />
Bright spring light loves us.<br />
3. Remove the first two words of each sentence in the original lesson (we get lesson 3) (five words and eight sentences, equal rhyme rule)</p>
<p>Bright spring scene<br />
Poetry and wine cups are full<br />
Bamboo hedge with green branches<br />
The fresh scent of spring<br />
Guests wait for the river to calm down<br />
The boat waiting at the dock was crowded with people<br />
The sound of singing is low<br />
A shadow with smiling eyes.<br />
4. Remove the last two words of each sentence in the original lesson, read backwards from the bottom up (we get lesson 4)<br />
(five words, eight sentences, rules in equal rhyme)<br />
Whose eyes are glossy and graceful<br />
The instrument sings in the distance<br />
The dock waits for the boat to go back and forth<br />
The river waits for visitors to cross again<br />
The colors of spring blend with the leaves<br />
Bamboo branches hang flowers on the hedge<br />
A cup of wine and poetic joy<br />
The spring light loves me.<br />
5. Remove the last three words of each sentence in the original lesson (we get lesson 5) (eight sentences &amp; four words)<br />
I love spring scenery<br />
The joy of wine poetry<br />
Flowers installed on bamboo hedges<br />
The leaves blend with the scent of spring<br />
Back and forth, customers wait<br />
Back and forth the boat waits<br />
Far away the sound of singing<br />
Let go of someone&#8217;s shadow.<br />
6. Remove the first three words of each sentence in the original lesson, read backwards from the bottom up (we get lesson 6) (eight sentences &amp; four words)<br />
Smile and smile at someone&#8217;s eyes<br />
Play bass and sing<br />
Crowds of people waiting<br />
The calm waves of the river wait<br />
Fresh spring colors<br />
Green bamboo branches<br />
Fill a cup of wine<br />
Bright spring light.<br />
7. Remove the first four words of each sentence in the original lesson (we get lesson 7) (eight sentences &amp; three words)<br />
Bright light<br />
The cup is full and empty<br />
Blue branches<br />
Bright colors<br />
The river is calm<br />
The wharf is crowded<br />
Bass guitar<br />
Smiling eyes.<br />
8. Remove the last four words of each sentence in the original lesson, read backwards from the bottom up (we get lesson 8) (eight sentences &amp; three words)<br />
Sleek silhouette<br />
Distant hum<br />
The boat goes back and forth<br />
Guests come over again<br />
Fragrance mixed with leaves<br />
Hedge with flowers<br />
Poetry is fun<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terror filled the heart of a World War I soldier when he saw his lifelong friend fall in battle.<br />
Trapped in a trench and artillery shells flying continuously overhead, the soldier asked his commander to allow him to go out into the &#8220;plain area&#8221; between the trenches to bring back his wounded comrade.</p>
<p>The commander said:</p>
<p>&#8211; You can go but I think the job won&#8217;t be worth it. Perhaps his friend was dead and he could lose his own life.</p>
<p>Regardless of the commander&#8217;s words, the soldier still left. Miraculously, he managed to reach his friend, lifted him onto his shoulders, and carried him back to their trench. As they both tumbled into the trench, the commander checked on the hit soldier and then looked sympathetically at his friend.</p>
<p>-I told you, that job is not worth it. &#8211; The commander said &#8211; Your friend is dead, and you are seriously injured.</p>
<p>The soldier replied:</p>
<p>&#8211; Even so, the job is still worth doing, boss.</p>
<p>&#8211; What do you mean by worth doing? Your friend is dead, right?</p>
<p>-Boss, it was worth doing because when I got to him, he was still alive and I was very satisfied when he told me &#8220;Jim, I knew that you would definitely come to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>In life, whether something is worth doing or not depends entirely on how we look at it. Be courageous and do what your heart tells you so that later in life you won&#8217;t have to regret not doing it. Hopefully each and every one of us will be in the true arms of such friends.<a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language">Vietnamese</a><a href="https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/">https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There were quite a few people attending the wedding. The neighbor called his worker over and said: &#8211; Hey, let&#8217;s go see how many people are attending the wedding over there.<br />
Physicians do leave. He placed a piece of wood on the threshold and sat on the wall waiting for guests to leave the house. They start to leave. Everyone who went out tripped over a log, cursed and continued walking. Only an old woman tripped over a log and immediately turned around and pushed the log aside.</p>
<p>Uncle workers returned to the owner.</p>
<p>The owner asked:</p>
<p>&#8211; Are there many people there?</p>
<p>The worker replied:</p>
<p>&#8211; There&#8217;s only one person and it&#8217;s an old woman.</p>
<p>&#8211; Why so?</p>
<p>&#8211; Because I left a log on the doorstep, everyone tripped over it, but no one bothered to remove it. Then do the same sheep. But an old woman pushed the log aside so that others wouldn&#8217;t trip and fall. The only man to do so. The old woman was alone.<a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language">Vietnamese</a><a href="https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/">https://tuvo123.github.io/tinhay4/en/mr-dos-poem/</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ten white swallows returned home<br />
The Tathagata often rests on the hem of his spring robe<br />
Shoulders tilted to the stream of silk<br />
A pair of peach mounds blooming on the fragrant snow</p>
<p>Vehicles on the road dust flower shop<br />
Through the white mist, the streets are fading in autumn<br />
The sound of birds is soaked in two seasons<br />
The falling seeds become colder and more indifferent as the clouds pass by</p>
<p>The cricket was sad and fell asleep<br />
The faint sound of ivory and mist flying<br />
When people return, stars bloom in their hands<br />
With shoes drenched in moonlight, the heels are long and dreamy</p>
<p>I advise it to sing on the shore<br />
I changed my shirt and indifferently raised my head<br />
I thought there was someone upstairs<br />
On spring day, gently sow damask balls</p>
<p>Long hair ends in the clouds far away<br />
Yellow butterfly pistil and evil emblem fly<br />
Use your arms to hold your hands<br />
Exchange silk scarves to remember sad days</p>
<p>From ancient mountain birds<br />
Coming here, I left apricot seeds at the end of the forest<br />
From you close green comedy<br />
Returning through desire, his soul blossomed into a flower of sadness</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m afraid of the rain<br />
Also took him to the downstream bridge<br />
This river flows in just one stream<br />
The clouds at the beginning of the river darken human hair at the end of the river</p>
<p>In the past, I was pregnant with my husband<br />
In spring I wear a peach shirt<br />
Autumn in blue sky<br />
In winter, I changed my floral shirt again</p>
<p>Flower on the way back to pick mustard buds<br />
Flower Just bring along a field of eggplants<br />
Flower Well, you don&#8217;t love me<br />
Climbing up the grapefruit branch, I miss you with tears in my eyes</p>
<p>Why do you take small, hesitant steps?<br />
By the bridge, the dew fell a few plums<br />
At night, light candles and write poetry<br />
The sound of footsteps still echoes half of my poem</p>
<p>The white lovebirds have flown away<br />
The sound is heard earnestly in the early winter sky<br />
At midnight, I covered myself with a pink blanket<br />
Listen to the cold flowers in the fields again</p>
<p>The bird died under the flower tree<br />
The cry fell in the middle of the pale river<br />
Tomorrow he will die under the peach tree<br />
Crying, I would like to shed my tears into eternity</p>
<p>Old city wall, old stele<br />
The soul of the sea mulberry calls in the flying reed flag<br />
In the afternoon, the jade bracelet was exchanged hands<br />
Give each other silk scarves at the end of the day to prepare</p>
<p>The long night is full of flower pistils<br />
Birds chirping at the tomb door and the moonlight knocks on the stele<br />
Please invite your hair back<br />
Looking at the moon, I couldn&#8217;t help but let the oath fly away</p>
<p>Waiting for each other to end this flower<br />
Just like the butterfly wings of the western hills are indifferent<br />
Find the dirty pages of poetry<br />
The old words of desire are now gone</p>
<p>The old clouds also left the mountains<br />
I also made that vow in the past<br />
Remember, you have to know how far you can reach<br />
Bird feathers of the northern sea, thin flowers on the eastern beach</p>
<p>Waiting for someone to be full of sadness and flowers<br />
I&#8217;ve been without you since the beginning of time following the wind and sails<br />
In the afternoon, open the gate of drifting clouds<br />
The majestic mountains are bright with the evening stars</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it, the street of pink dust<br />
The lake interrupts the flow of swallows<br />
Let&#8217;s compete for this flower wine<br />
Tomorrow, I go to wild crane city outside to sing crazy songs</p>
